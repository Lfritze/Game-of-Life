1. Setup simple architecture
  - What do we need?
      Components
        Game control buttons
        Game grid
        Game play state - import logic from conwayLogic.js (doublebuffering)
        Preloaded patterns
  
gamePlay.js will import, 
  gameGrid, 
  gameButtons, 
  samplePatterns, 
  logic in conwayLogic,
  samplePatternData

________________________________________________

Let's start with writing the logic now

2. conwayLogic.js Implementation 

  alive = 1
  dead = 0

  Let's try Von Neumann neighborhood
