1. Setup simple architecture
  - What do we need?
      Components
        Game control buttons
        Game grid
        Game play state - import logic from conwayLogic.js (doublebuffering)
        Preloaded patterns
  
gamePlay.js will import, 
  gameGrid, 
  gameButtons, 
  samplePatterns, 
  logic in conwayLogic,
  samplePatternData

________________________________________________

Let's start by writing the logic now

2. conwayLogic.js Implementation 

  alive = 1
  dead = 0

  Let's try Von Neumann neighborhood
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood


________________________________________________

3. Let's start making the gameGrid

is cell 0 or 1 ? - ternary
show cell 
mouse event

show row - map cell, var - show cell

render <div> board game grid - via props 

________________________________________________

4. Let's start with gamePlay and gameButtons.js

gamePlay is going to import from SamplePatternData, GameGrid, Game Buttons, SamplePatterns and (speedKills,  nextGeneration, createBoard, randomMix) from conwayLogic
